Welcome to my website! Here, you can learn a bit more about me and whatever currently catches my interest.<p>I share articles and blogs that I find interesting in the <a href=/links>links</a> section. These are mostly about software engineering and technology, but you might also find some posts about my other random interests.<p>Every now and then, I might write up some of my own thoughts and share them in the <a href=/blog>blog</a>.<h1 id=work>work</h1><p>I'm an experienced fullstack engineer with a varied background. I've had the chance to work at companies ranging from small Irish startups to large multinational corporations.<p>I've worked with a bunch of languages like Typescript, C#, Python, Java, Kotlin and with technologies including React, PostgreSQL, Apache Spark and Apache Druid.<p>I love working on projects that have a tangible impact on people's everyday lives. I'm always on the lookout for new things to learn whether it's tech, software engineering practices and principals, or even just meeting new people.<p>I'm a big fan of pair programming, CI/CD and making small incremental changes. I believe in keeping code simple and trying to avoid complexity wherever possible. I also believe in making data-driven product decisions by getting small, functional features out to customers early and often.<h1 id=education>education</h1><p>I have a Master's degree in Computer Science from Trinity College Dublin. My dissertation titled "Using light fields to enable deep monocular depth estimation", along with the accompanying code, can be found on GitHub <a href=https://github.com/NiallEHunt/MonocularDepth-Using-LightFields>here</a>.<h1 id=p-s>p.s.</h1><p>This website was created using <a href=https://www.getzola.org/>Zola</a> a static site engine and I used the <a href=https://github.com/not-matthias/apollo>Apollo</a> theme.</section></article></main></div>
